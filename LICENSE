I'm making these sources public but have not ironed out all the
licensing issues.  To be safe, just follow and contribute (if you
want) to the mainline and do not publish your own version.

The plan for now is that the Java components of this software be
licensed under EPL v1.0 <http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html>.

The original C code (v9t9/v9t9-c) is marked in sources as being 
licensed under GNU GPL v2, but as that is not being developed 
right now, just ignore it or leave it out if you choose to redistribute 
sources.
