-- passing -r params for demo doesn't init screen

-- a lot of memory is being leaked since i changed the command file
	subsystem (300k per session loaded)

-- RS232 support is not well-tested and is known to be flakey under both
Linux and Win32.

-- disk image (disk-on-a-disk or DOAD) support is not correct for double-
sided images imported from outside programs (I think the track ordering
is wrong for the second side).

-- the GTK interface for the DSR ROMs does not indicate when DSR ROMs
are missing entirely

-- the GTK memory interface is incomplete (the set of buttons at the
bottom of the dialog all send text to command central)

-- saving sessions can be broken depending on a complex combination
of replacing module ROMs via direct commands like "DefineMemory" and
wrapper commands like "ModuleROMFileName", as well as remembering 
whether an entry in the module database is active ("LoadModule").

All of these eventually use "DefineMemory", but the session file needs
to have a command for "LoadModule" instead of the raw memory mappings,
in order for the GTK modules database dialog to have a starting 
selection.

-- v9t9 forth:  the FILES wordset is implemented inefficiently
