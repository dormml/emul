CONFIGURATION
-------------

The first time you extract the sources, or after checking out from CVS,
or after running "make distclean", run "./rebuild.sh" to configure and
build v9t9 and its utility programs.

If you have "automake" installed, then "make" will update the Makefiles
itself, so there will be no pressing need to perform the steps above.

If your software configuration changes (i.e., adding libraries or programs
that v9t9 could use or would miss), execute "rm -f config.cache ; ./configure"
at the top level to synchronize the configuration headers with the sources,
and then execute "make" to rebuild.


INSTALLATION
------------

After building, "make install" will install v9t9 to ${prefix}/bin/v9t9
(usually /usr/local/bin; see the "--prefix" or "--bindir" option to
"configure"), and associated utilities, DSR ROMs and V9t9 FORTH to
{datadir}/v9t9 (usually /usr/local/share/v9t9; see the "--datadir" option
to "configure").

Problems you may encounter:

-- cannot use SVGAlib:

svgalib: cannot get I/O permissions

Install v9t9 (this will enable the suid bit on v9t9), or, if executing
from the source directory, execute "chown root:root source/v9t9" and
"chmod +s source/v9t9".

-- when using SVGAlib, the error:

svgalib: mmap error in paged screen memory

or

svgalib: mmap error in shared screen memory

means you should reconfigure SVGAlib's Makefile.cfg to change this line:

	BACKGROUND = y

to

	# BACKGROUND = y

Newer Linux kernels apparently do not allow this anymore.  This doesn't
affect the functionality of v9t9.  (It never ran in the background anyway.)
