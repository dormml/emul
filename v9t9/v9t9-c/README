This is a legacy version of V9t9 between v6.0 and the Java version.  
It was originally built against GTK 1.2.  I fixed it so it will build
and run, a bit, on GTK 2, but it was never bullet-tested.

The only real advantage over the Java version is, it's faster, if
you want to run insanely fast.  But the architecture is quite poor
so it cannot be extended easily to do new things.
