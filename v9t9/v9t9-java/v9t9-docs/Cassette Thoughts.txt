0.02 seconds

up,down,  down, up  ==> 14 times

0.05 seconds ==> 35

700 times a second  (1400 iterations)   between 0x22 and 0x23

0.01 seconds:  28 flips (biphase)  for zeroes -- two per SBZ for zero

seems to be

-0.5, 0.3, 0.1 (0), 0.5, -0.3, -0.1, -0.5

Writing a 0xff, with SBZ then SBO, then this pattern repeats twice as quickly.
