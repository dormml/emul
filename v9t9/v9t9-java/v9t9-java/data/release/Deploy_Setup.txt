SETUP
=========

Go into the <yourApplication> folder, execute "keytool -genkey -keystore $HOME/.keystore.v9t9 -alias v9t9", 
and enter all required information.


BUILDING
=========

Invoke "build_standalone.xml" *after* compiling via Eclipse (TODO)

Then enter the same keystore password when invoking the launch config for "build_standalone.xml".

If running via ant, pass '-Dstorepass=...' with the password, and also supply 
'-Dkeystore=$HOME/.keystore.v9t9'.  

Two versions of the v9t9.jnlp are deployed, v9t9-local.jnlp for testing locally
(e.g. "javaws path/to/v9t9-local.jnlp") and v9t9-remote.jnlp for using on a web server.

Pass a new 'v9t9.host' and 'v9t9.root' property to override the URL encoded into 
v9t9-remote.jnlp and used by the test web server (next).

 
TESTING
=========

The 'test-httpd.py' will publish a web server on localhost:8080 providing ${v9t9.root}/v9t9.html
for testing the web launcher.
