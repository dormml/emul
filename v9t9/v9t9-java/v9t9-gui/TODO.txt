Fix keyboard implementation:

-- too close a tie between the host keyboard and the 99/4A CRU map
-- allow independent event handling of key presses/releases to support e.g. onscreen keyboard
-- handle host weirdnesses, like repeats on some keycodes and downs getting lost (?) 

-- fix confusing uses of shifts:
	-- 'fake' shift tracking for rolls of e.g. arrow-left, arrow-right, etc.
	-- shift to select alternate joystick when using numpad
	-- realshift vs. what's in the CRU map
	
-- cases:
	-- host Shift+'[' is FCTN-F;  target should see this as only FCTN,F and not SHIFT,FCTN,F;
	but if Shift is kept down while say 'I' is pressed, then target should then see SHIFT,I
	and not FCTN,SHIFT,I.
	
	-- it seems the host can track a set of currently pressed symbols (including shifts).  
	On each "scan", it repeatedly extracts the longest subset of symbols that maps to the 
	target.  Whichever ones are left (single-length sets) are set directly.
