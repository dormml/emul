SETUP
=========

Go into the <yourApplication> folder, execute "keytool -genkey -keystore $HOME/.keystore.v9t9 -alias v9t9", 
and enter all required information.

If regenerating a key, you'll need to remove the .keystore.v9t9 file first.


BUILDING
=========

Build from the v9t9/v9t9-java/v9t9-gui directory where several build*.xml files live.

If you have built from Eclipse before, invoke "ant -f build_standalone.xml clean" to be 
sure all is well.

Then invoke "ant -f build_standalone.xml -Dkeystore=$HOME/.keystore.v9t9 -Dstorepass=...".  

V9t9 is built into its respective project directories and the JARs and shared libraries
are sent to <v9t9-home>/build/bin .

Two versions of the v9t9.jnlp are deployed, v9t9-local.jnlp for testing locally 
and v9t9-remote.jnlp for using on a web server.

The remote launcher uses a hardcoded IP address for testing.  Pass a new 'v9t9.host' and 
'v9t9.root' property to override the URL encoded into v9t9-remote.jnlp (next) and used by the
test web server.

A full command example to build and override the web testing variables:

ant -Dkeystore=\$HOME/.keystore.v9t9 -Dstorepass=...thepassword... \
	-Dv9t9.host=mycomputer.mydomain -Dv9t9.root=/path/to/my/v9t9 \
	-f build_standalone.xml 
 
 
TESTING
=========

To test locally, use "javaws <path/to>/v9t9-local.jnlp" -- from the "v9t9-gui" directory
this is in "../../build/bin/v9t9".

To test the remote deployer, use 'test-httpd.py' to publish a web server on localhost:8080.
Launch a browser that supports Java 6 and open ${v9t9.root}/v9t9.html and click "Launch".

Note: on some browsers, the Launch button will simply trigger a download of the .jnlp
file -- you may have to manually launch the .jnlp from the Downloads folder.
